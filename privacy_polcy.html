                the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request

                provide
                us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology
                (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or
                electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally
                accepted industry standards.</p>
            <h3>Changes to this privacy policy</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. Changes

                changes
                to this policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what
